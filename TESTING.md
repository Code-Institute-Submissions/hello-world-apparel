As a user of the site I want and/or expect:

1. to browse products on the website
- all users used the main navigation as their starting point to search :white_check_mark:
- the filter function and sort by was used to navigate through the product list :white_check_mark:
- search functionality was used by one user to search for 'coffee tshirt' :white_check_mark:
2. to view details about a product I like on the website
3. to create an account
4. to view ratings on a product to aid in my decision making
5. to contact the company with a question
6. to search for items
7. to add items to a cart
